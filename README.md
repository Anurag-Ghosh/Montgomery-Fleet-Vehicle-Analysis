# Montgomery-Fleet-Vehicle-Analysis
# Final Project for Course 2 of IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate

Assignment Scenario Part 1: In this final assigment, you will be following the scenario of a recently hired Junior Data Analyst in a local government office, who has been tasked with importing some data from another department which relates to inventory information about their fleet of vehicles. The data is in comma-separated value (CSV) format and the data also needs cleaning up before you can start to run any kind of analysis on it.

Assignment Scenario Part 2: In this final assigment, you will be following the scenario of a recently hired Junior Data Analyst in a local government office, who has been tasked with sorting and analyzing fleet inventory data that was previously imported and cleaned. You plan to use pivot tables to analyze the data in preparation for the results to be visualized in a dashboard and added to a data findings report later.
