In this final assigment, you will be following the scenario of a recently hired Junior Data Analyst in a local government office, who has been tasked with sorting and analyzing fleet inventory data that was previously imported and cleaned.

###### Skills Used:
Using the Format as Table option to format the data as a table, using AutoSum to calculate values (Sum, Average, Min, Max, Count), using the PivotTable feature to create pivot tables and sort their data.
